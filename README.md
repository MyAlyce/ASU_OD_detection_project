What is this project: Zepp app made for Amazfit Balances intended to track the user's heart and sleep data and log it onto Google Drive as well as providing an emergency relief operation if it detects a dangerous health trend (such as high heartrate).

How to run this project on the simulator:
1. Install the simulator here: https://docs.zepp.com/docs/guides/tools/simulator/download/ and then open when it is finished installing
2. Select the Amazfit Balance V2.0.0 to be the model of the simulator and click "Emulator". This should open a window to a basic analog clock 
3. In this file, navigate to the "app" directory on your CLI and type "zeus dev". This app is intended for the Amazfit Balance
4. Give the emulator a few minutes, but it should eventually show the HUD of the app.
5. You can use the console to check console.log statements and debug
6. Refer to the docs for understanding basic syntax of Zepp https://docs.zepp.com/docs/intro/
