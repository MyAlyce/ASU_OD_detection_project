The MyAlyce app is made for the Amazfit Balance smartwatch on the Zepp OS platform. This repository is part of an effort by the MyAlyce team to create a platform for recovering drug addicts. Our program collects vital health data and integrates this with Google Drive/Google Sheets.

How to run this project on the simulator:

1. Install the simulator [here](https://docs.zepp.com/docs/guides/tools/simulator/download/) and then open when it is finished installing
2. Select the Amazfit Balance V2.0.0 to be the model of the simulator and click "Emulator". This should open a window to a basic analog clock
3. In this file, navigate to the "app" directory on your CLI and type `zeus dev`. This app is intended for the Amazfit Balance
4. Give the emulator a few minutes, but it should eventually show the HUD of the app.
5. You can use the console to check console.log statements and debug
6. Refer to the [docs](https://docs.zepp.com/docs/intro/) for understanding basic syntax and architecture of Zepp
